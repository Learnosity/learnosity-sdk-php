# Learnosity SDK - PHP

Include this package into your own codebase to ease integration with any of the Learnosity APIs.

This SDK should run on PHP 5.3+

## Installation
Installation should be as simple as possible, there are no external dependancies and this package should integrate with any existing codebase.

### Composer

Using Composer is the recommended way to install the Learnosity SDK for PHP. In order to use the SDK with Composer, you must add "learnosity/learnosity-sdk-php" as a dependency in your project's composer.json file.

```
  {
    "require": {
        "learnosity/learnosity-sdk-php": "0.5.1"
    }
  }
```

Then, install your dependencies 

```
composer install
```


### git clone

```
git clone git@github.com:Learnosity/learnosity-sdk-php.git
```

If you don't have an SSH key loaded into github you can clone via HTTPS (not recommended)

```
git clone https://github.com/Learnosity/learnosity-sdk-php.git
```

### Examples
To load any of the examples, it's easiest to use the PHP local server (assumes PHP >= 5.4)

```
cd learnosity-sdk-php/examples
php -S localhost:5555
```

You can play with the `examples` folder, and review the code to get a feel for how things work. In production you'll likely just use the contents of `src` in your own project. Eg:

```
/yourProjectRoot
  /src
  /vendor
    /learnosity-sdk-php/src/LearnositySdk
```

With this in mind you'll likely have this in your projects `.gitignore`

```
learnosity-sdk-php/src/examples
learnosity-sdk-php/src/*.md
```

### Autoload

This packages follows the PSR code convention which includes namespaces and import statements. Add the LearnositySdk autoloader or use your own (use *LearnositySdk* as the namespace):

```
require_once __DIR__ . '/LearnositySdk/autoload.php';
```


## Usage

### Init




The Init class is used to create the necessary *security* and *request* details used to integrate with a Learnosity API. Most often this will be a JavaScript object.

```
//Include the Init classes.
use LearnositySdk\Request\Init;
```

The Init constructor takes up to 5 arguments:

 * [string]  service type
 * [array]   security details (**no secret**)
 * [string]  secret
 * [request] request details *(optional)*
 * [string]  action *(optional)*

```
// Instantiate the SDK Init class with your security and request data:
$Init = new Init(
   'questions',
   [
       'consumer_key' => 'yis0TYCu7U9V4o7M',
       'domain'       => 'localhost',
       'user_id'      => 'demo_student'
   ],
   'superfragilisticexpialidocious',
   [
       'type'      => 'local_practice',
       'state'     => 'initial',
       'questions' => [
           [
               'response_id'        => '60005',
               'type'               => 'association',
               'stimulus'           => 'Match the cities to the parent nation.',
               'stimulus_list'      => ['London', 'Dublin', 'Paris', 'Sydney'],
               'possible_responses' => ['Australia', 'France', 'Ireland', 'England'],
               'validation' => [
                   'valid_responses' => [
                       ['England'], ['Ireland'], ['France'], ['Australia']
                   ]
               ]
           ]
       ]
   ]
);

// Call the generate() method to retrieve a JavaScript object
$request = $Init->generate();

// Pass the object to the initialisation of any Learnosity API
LearnosityApp.init($request);
```

#### Init() Arguments
**service**<br>
A string representing the Learnosity service (API) you want to integrate with. Valid options are:

* assess
* author
* data
* events
* items
* questions
* reports

**security**<br>
An array^ that includes your *consumer_key* but does not include your *secret*. The SDK sets defaults for you, but valid options are:

* consumer_key
* domain (optional - defaults to *localhost*)
* timestamp (optional - the SDK will generate this for you)
* user_id (optional - not necessary for all APIs)

^Note – the SDK accepts a JSON string and native PHP arrays.

**secret**<br>
Your private key, as provided by Learnosity.

**request**<br>
An optional associative array^ of data relevant to the API being used. This will be any data minus the security details that you would normally use to initialise an API.

^Note – the SDK accepts a JSON string and native PHP arrays.

**action**<br>
An optional string used only if integrating with the Data API. Valid options are:

* get
* set
* update
* delete

### Remote



The Remote class is used to make server side, cross domain requests. Think of it as a cURL wrapper.

You'll call either get() or post() (mimicking the HTTP request type you want to make) with the following arguments:

* [string] URL
* [array]  Data payload
* [array]  Options


```
//Include the Remote classes.
use LearnositySdk\Request\Remote;
```

```
// Instantiate the SDK Remote class:
$Remote = new Remote();
// Call get() or post() with a URL:
$response = $Remote->get('http://schemas.learnosity.com/latest/questions/templates');

// getBody() gives you to body of the request
$requestPacket = $response->getBody();
```

#### Arguments

**URL**<br>
A string URL, including schema and path. Eg:

```
https://schemas.learnosity.com/latest/questions/templates
```

**Data**<br>
An optional array of data to be sent as a payload. For GET it will be a URL encoded query string.

**Options**<br>
An optional array of [cURL parameters](http://www.php.net/manual/en/curl.constants.php).

#### Remote methods
The following methods are available after making a `get()` or `post()`.

**getBody()**<br>
Returns the body of the response payload.

**getError()**<br>
Returns an array that includes the error code and message (if an error was thrown)

**getHeader()**<br>
Currently only returns the *content_type* header of the response.

**getSize()**<br>
Returns the size of the response payload in bytes.

**getStatusCode()**<br>
Returns the HTTP status code of the response.

### DataApi

This is a helper class for use with the Data API. It creates the initialisation packet and sends a request to the Data API, returning an instance of Remote. You can then interact as you would with Remote, eg ```getBody()```

#### request()

Used for a single request to the Data API. You can call as many times as necessary.


```
$DataApi = new DataApi();
$response = $DataApi->request(
    'https://data.learnosity.com/v0.27/itembank/items',
    [
       'consumer_key' => 'yis0TYCu7U9V4o7M',
       'domain'       => 'localhost'
    ],
    'superfragilisticexpialidocious',
    [
       'limit' => 20
    ]
);
```

#### requestRecursive()

Used to make recursive requests to the Data API, using the *next* token, for as much data is returned based on the request filtering provided.

You can pass a callback as the 5th argument, that will be executed upon completion of every request.

```
$DataApi = new DataApi();

$response = $DataApi->requestRecursive(
    'https://data.learnosity.com/v0.27/itembank/items',
    [
       'consumer_key' => 'yis0TYCu7U9V4o7M',
       'domain'       => 'localhost'
    ],
    'superfragilisticexpialidocious',
    [
       'limit' => 20
    ],
    function ($data) {
        $this->processData($data);
    }
);

function processData($data)
{
    // Do something with $data
}
```

#### Overriding the remote options

You can send an array to the DataAPI constructor to override any remote (cURL) options, eg:

```
$options = array(
    'connect_timeout' => 20
    'timeout' => 60
);

$dataapi = new DataApi($options);
```
